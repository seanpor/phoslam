phoslam
=======

The phoslam package has been designed to use either the algorithm developed by Bowes et al. (2008) or an adjustment of the algorithm by Greene et al. (2012) to apportion the phosphorus load in a river to point and diffuse sources. Outcomes include the percentage of the load apportioned to point and diffuse sources, the percentage of time flow is dominated by point sources (based on flow data provided either low or high frequency) and total phosphorus load. The package is currently under development with future improvements to include automated bootstrapping to provide confidence intervals of outcomes.
